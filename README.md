# Simple Todo List
Todo list for simple task management
This is a simple to do list app that I created for my portfolio. It comes with some simple features that you can use to interact with it.

# All tasks tab
Creating, editing and deleting tasks directly. These interactions with the task can be carried out not only by directly pressing the buttons on it, but also through the pop-up window of the selected task.

### Creating, editing and deleting tasks. 
1. __Creating task__
+ To create a task, you need to use the "Add new task" button. After clicking it, a task layout will appear in the list of tasks with input fields for its name and description. At the bottom of the layout there will be 2 buttons: "Cancel" and "Add task". 
+ You cannot add another task until you are done with the current one. 
+ Also, you cannot create a task with an empty name.
2. __Editing task__
+ To edit the title and description of the task, click on the "pencil" button. After that, a small editor with input fields will open, where you can make changes.
+ To save the changes, click the "Save" button
3. __Deleting Task__
+ To delete a task, click on the "recycle bin" button. The task will be deleted.

### Task popup
The task popup offers some advanced functionality for interacting with the task, so it has several sections inside it:
+ Date the task was created (it is for informational purposes only)
+ Deadline for the task (it is purely informative, but the function of editing it using an interactive calendar will be added)
+ Task group. The task group can be changed using the drop-down menu in this section. If you have not created any groups or have cleared their list, then the drop-down menu will notify you of this.
+ Search for a task in the dropdown menu. If you have created too many groups, you can use the search among them in the drop-down menu. You just need to enter the name of the group or several letters contained in the name of the desired task.
+ Subtasks (In development)

# Groups tab
Creation of groups, editing and deletion of groups in which you can group tasks. 
+ You can add an unlimited number of tasks to groups, but one task can only be in one group (it will be fixed in future versions). 
+ Tasks can be added both in the group itself and through the task pop-up menu in a special section.
+ Search for tasks in a group. Each open group has a field for entering the name of the task you want to search for. You need to enter the name or several letters contained in the name of the desired task and the group will display matches with the entered name.
